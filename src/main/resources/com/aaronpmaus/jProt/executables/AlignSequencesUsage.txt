          Display the usage file.
      --mol1-f fname
          This file must either be a PDB file or a fasta file. If it is
          a PDB file it must end in the .pdb extension and conform to
          the PDB File Format Version 3.30. Otherwise, the file must be
          a fasta file ending in the .fasta extension.
      --mol2-f fname
          The file for molecule two. The format is the same as mol1-f.
      --mol1-chain chainID
          The chain from mol1 to use in the alignment, capital letter
          indicating the chain. This argument is only applicable if PDBs
          are provided as input, otherwise it will be ignored. If
          omitted, the entire sequence will be used.
      --mol2-chain chainID
          The chain from mol2 to use in the alignment, capital letter
          indicating the chain. This argument is only applicable if PDBs
          are provided as input, otherwise it will be ignored. If
          omitted, the entire sequence will be used.
      --mol1-entry entryNumber
          A number indicating which entry to use in the alignment.
          Possible values: [1,N], where N is the number of entries in
          the FASTA File. If omitted the first entry will be used.
      --mol2-entry entryNumber
          A number indicating which entry to use in the alignment.
          Possible values: [1,N], where N is the number of entries in
          the FASTA File. If omitted the first entry will be used.

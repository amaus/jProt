          Display the usage file.
      -a, --angular-distance
          Calculate and print the angular distance.
      --mol1-f fname
          This file must be a PDB file. It must conform to the PDB File
          Format Version 3.30.
      --mol2-f fname
          The file for molecule two. The format is the same as mol1-f.
      --ros
          Find the regions of similarity between the structures using  a
          default threshold of 1.0 angstroms. These are the sets of
          residues that are internally consistent. That is, the intra
          structure distances between the CA's of all pairs of residues
          this this set are the same (under a default tolerance of 1.0
          angstroms) in both structures.
      --ros-t d
          Find the regions of similarity between the structures using
          the tolerance d.
      --diff
          Find the regions of dissimilarity between the structures.
          These are the sets of residues where none of their intra
          structure distances are preserved between the structures. By
          default, the similarity threshold is 1.0 angstroms.
      --diff-t d
          Find the regions of dissimilarity between the structures using
          the threshold d.
      --gdt
          Global Distance Test: Iteratively find the largest regions of
          similarity between the two structures under increasing
          thresholds. The thresholds are {1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0}.
      --gdt-ha
          Global Distance Test - High Accuracy: the same as gdt except
          with thresholds: {0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0}.
      --gdt-plot
          Global Distance Test: Operates as --gdt but with thresholds
          {0.5, 1.0, 1.5, ..., 9.5, 10.0}.
      --chimera
          Print out a chimera script to color the regions of similarity
          found by ros, gdt, gdt-ha, or diff.
      --pymol
          Print out a pymol script to color the regions of similarity
          found by ros, gdt, gdt-ha, or diff.

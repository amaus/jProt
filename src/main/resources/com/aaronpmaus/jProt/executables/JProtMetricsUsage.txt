Usage: JProtMetrics [<options>] <mol1-f fname> <mol2-f fname>
  options :
      -h
          Display the usage file.
      -a, --angular-distance
          Calculate and print the angular distance.
      --mol1-f fname
          This file must either be a PDB file. If it is a PDB file it
          must end in the .pdb extension and conform to the PDB File
          Format Version 3.30.
      --mol2-f fname
          The file for molecule two. The format is the same as mol1-f.
      --ls, --local-similarity
          Find the regions of local similarity between the structures
          using  a default threshold of 1.0 angstroms. These are the
          sets of residues that are internally consistent, that is, the
          intra structure distances between all residues are the same
          (that is their distance is under the default threshold of 1.0
          angstroms) in both structures. A pymol script to select and
          color these regions is printed to the screen.
      --ls-t d
          Find the regions of local similarity between the structures
          using the threshold d specified.
      --gdt
          Global Distance Test: Iteratively find the largest regions of
          similarity between the two structures under increasing
          thresholds. Print out a pymol script that selects and colors
          these regions and prints out the number and percent of
          residues within each region along with the average of the
          percents. The default thresholds are {1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0}.
      --gdt-ha
          Global Distance Test - High Accuracy: the same as gdt except
          with thresholds: {0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0}.
      --gdt-plot
          Global Distance Test: Operates as --gdt but with thresholds
          {0.5, 1.0, 1.5, ..., 9.5, 10.0}. Will calculate the statistics
          for both gdt and gdt-ha.
      --chimera
          Print out a chimera script to color the regions of similarity
          found by either local similarity or gdt. By default, a pymol
          script is printed. This changes that behavior.
